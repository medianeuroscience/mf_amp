# Measuring Moral Intuition: 
## Comparing Affect Misattribution Procedures, Lexical Decision Tasks, and Real-World Evaluations

An experiment conducted in Winter/Spring 2019 in the Media Neuroscience Lab at the University of California Santa Barbara

File is added. As quick reminder, I had to create two columns for correct responses, since AMP and LDT differ in what is a correct response. In AMP, correct (L) means positive valence if word is positive and (R) is correct when word has negative valence. In LDT, correct (L) means when word is either MORAL or NEUTRAL and (R) is correct when word in NONWORD. Keep in mind that in AMP, people are shown a non-word after the moral word, so the correct response has to be set towards the MORAL word. Lastly, is it possible to add the words “positive” and “negative” only in the AMP? Rene wanted those as control. I also copied this message into the README of the GitHub as reference. Check the notebook for words per task etc. THANKS! This will be fun.
