# Advancing the AMP / LDT

Welcome to the documentation for the Moral Foundations Affect Misattribution Procedure \(MF-AMP\) and Lexical Decision Task \(LDT\) procedures designed in `PsychoPy` by the Media Neuroscience Lab at the University of California Santa Barbara. 

There are currently two iterations of these experiments. Experiment 1 was collected in the Winter 2019 and Experiment 2 was collected in the Summer and Fall 2019.

The overall goal of this project is to create an open-sourced and reproducible version of the AMP and the LDT that addresses some salient concerns about each of the protocols. For a full rationale see the manuscript submitted to the 2019 Meeting of the National Communication Association \(file below\).
