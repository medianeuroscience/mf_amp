Introduction
============

This research is designed to understand the interacting roles of cognitive load and perceptual load on media processing performance and flow. Cognitive load has been shown to modulate media processing, memory, and message effectiveness. Currently within media processing literature, models assume cognitive load is a uni-dimensional construct dependent on only working memory, whereas literature from the psychological and brain sciences, such as The Load Theory of Selective Attention and Cognitive Control (LTSACC) [1]_, has suggested that load in the processing system can be meaningfully separated into at least two at least two subcomponents: perceptual load and cognitive load. This perspective is incorporated into a recent update to the LC4MP [2]_.

Providing support for load in both stages in a dynamic environment rich in sensory information can assist media psychology scholars in refining predictions of message processing and effects and can assist cognitive psychologists in the development of experimental paradigms which more accurately resemble real world situations. In addition, we seek to replicate previous work [3]_ which found a correlation between media multitasking and decrements in performance in working memory dependent tasks, and between media multitasking and attentional problems in everyday life. 

The current study examines the effect(s) of cognitive and perceptual load on primary task performance (game score) and secondary task performance (as secondary task reaction time). Individual differences of relevance to cognitive processing, such as ADHD and self-reported media Multitasking are also considered.

Hypotheses
----------

This study has two primary hypotheses: 

**H1:** It is hypothesized that cognitive load will negatively affect performance in both primary and secondary tasks but that perceptual load will only negatively affect performance in the secondary task.

**H2:** It is hypothesized that perceptual load will differentially affect primary task performance in ADHD and non-ADHD groups.
