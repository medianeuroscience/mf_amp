Survey Measures
===============

In this experiment, a number of demographic and psychographic measures are collected. To view the full survey, please see :download:`full_survey <images/survey.pdf>`

ASRS v1.1
---------

The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS v1.1) [1]_ is a widely used and validated self-report measure for ADHD. It is primarily used as a clinical pre-screener, but has been found to be highly accurate at classifying ADHD diagnosis in adults. The measure consists of 18 questions, answered on a scale of 1 (*Never*) to 5 (*Very often/Always*). These questions concern a wide variety of ADHD-associated behaviors, including hyperkinesis, forgetfulness, impulsiveness, and working memory failures. 

ARCES
-----

The Attention-Related Cognitive Errors Scale (ARCES) [2]_ consists of 12 items aimed at indexing attentional failures in everyday life, such as absent-mindedness and forgetfulness. It has been found to be highly correlated with the ASRS v1.1 and predictive of ADHD-related performance differences [3]_. In this protocol, the ARCES will serve to further validate responses on the ASRS v1.1.  

MMI
---

The media multitasking index (MMI) [4]_ is designed to capture two primary things: how much time a given participant uses a variety of media (e.g. print, online video) in a given week, and how much time participants multitask with media. In this version, 13 forms of media will be tested: print media, television, computer based video, music, non-music audio, video games, telephone/voice calls, instant messaging, text messaging, email, web surfing, other computer-based applications ;(e.g. Word), and other mobile apps (e.g. Snapchat or Instagram). Following this, participants will be asked how often they use each of the listed media while simultaneously engaging in another, responding on a 0 (*Never*) to 4 (*Most of the time*) scale for each medium. An individual's media multitasking score will be created by averaging all of these responses. Media for which no usage will be reported will be excluded from averages on a per-participant basis.
