Experimental Protocol
=====================

Recruitment and Compensation
----------------------------

Participants were recruited from the SONA participation pool in the Department of Communication at the University of California Santa Barbara.

Subjects who participated in the study received 1.5 SONA credits. Additionally, the top three high scorers overall during the data collection quarter received a $50 Visa gift card. An email notification was sent to each of the three participants with the higest scores during the week following the final data collection appointment.

During Gameplay
---------------

Participants played 25 minutes of *Asteroid Impact*. There was a 1-minute practice round followed by six minutes of gameplay in each condition (perceptual load: high x low, cognitive load: high x low). All conditions except the practice condition were presented in randomized order.


Data Upload
^^^^^^^^^^^

After all measurements are completed, the study coordinator will offload all gameplay logs onto a flash drive and will delete the data on the lab computers.
