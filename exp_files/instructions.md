## Introduction (at the beginning of experiment)

Welcome and thank you for your interest in this study! 
The goal of this experiment is to better understand how people process and react to language. 
To better understand these mechanisms, you will be asked to complete three different word rating tasks, followed by a short survey. 
Each rating task follows a slightly different procedure. Before executing each task, you will receive detailed instructions on how to perform the task correctly. 
It is very important that you pay close attention to what is being required in each task. 

Before we begin the experiment, please place the index finger of your right hand on the left arrow key and the ring finger of your right hand on the right arrow key. 
Please try to keep your hand in this position throughout all rating tasks. 
If you are ready to start the experiment, please press the right arrow key.

## Instructions for the AMP 

In this task, you will be exposed to a selection of words. 
After briefly seeing a word, you will be exposed to a blank screen, followed by a non-word (e.g., bupple) and another blank screen. 
You are then asked to rate whether the non-word made you feel positive or negative as quickly as you can. 
It is very important that you focus on evaluating the non-word, not the first word that you saw! 
If the non-word makes you feel positive, press the LEFT-ARROW key. 
If the non-word makes you feel negative, please press the RIGHT-ARROW key. 

Here are two examples of the task. You do not have to rate the non-word, yet. 
Instead, please focus on the workflow of the task.

Now that you have familiarized yourself with the task, we can start the word rating. 
Remember to focus on evaluating the non-word, not the first word that you saw! 
If the non-word makes you feel positive, press the LEFT-ARROW key. 
If the non-word makes you feel negative, please press the RIGHT-ARROW key. 

The task will start in five seconds.

## Instructions for the LDT

During this task, you will be exposed to a selection of words and non-words. 
Every trail during this task will briefly display either a word or a non-word, followed by a quick display of ‘&’ symbols. 
After seeing the ‘&’ symbols, your task is to decide as quickly as possible whether the displayed stimulus equalled a word or a non-word. 
If you think that the displayed stimulus was indeed a word, press the left-arrow key. 
If you think that the displayed stimulus was a non-word, please press the right arrow key. 

Here are two examples of the task. You do not have to rate the displayed stimulus, yet. 
Instead, please focus on the workflow of the task.

~ EXAMPLES ~ 

Now that you have familiarized yourself with the task, we can start the rating procedure. 
Remember to focus on evaluating whether the displayed stimulus reflected a word or a non-word. 
If you think that a presented stimulus reflected a word, please press the LEFT-ARROW key. 
If you think that the displayed stimulus resembles a non-word please press the RIGHT-ARROW key. 

The task will start in five seconds.
