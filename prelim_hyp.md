# Initial thoughts:
- Some hypotheses are going to be "word-based" (meaning that we expect words of certain categories to be responded to differently from other words). 
- Some are going to be "person-based" (meaning that we expect people of certain groups to respond to words differently)
- Some are going to be "protocol-based" (meaning that we expect certain differences in the protocol to affect the way in which people respond to certain words -- presentation time, etc.)

## Word-based hypotheses:
- Positively valenced words will elicit a greater proportion of "pleasant" ratings for the symbols/nonwords that they immediately precede.
- Negatively valenced words will elicit a greater proportion of "unpleasant" ratings for the symbols/nonwords that they immediately precede.
- Higher-weighted words will be associated with more consistent responses (whether pleasant or unpleasant).
- Higher-weighted words will be more likely to be encoded in memory (better recognized) than lower-weighted words.
- Moral words will be more quickly & accurately recognized as words (compared to neutral words) in the LDT 

## Protocol-based hypotheses
- Longer presentation of the primes in the AMP will lead to greater recognition of the prime words in the memory task
- Longer presentation of the primes in the AMP will lead to greater self-reported reliance on the primes for rating the symbols
- Longer presentation of the primes in the AMP will increase the influence of the prime over the valence of the response.
- In the LDT, the gap in accuracy/RT between moral words and neutral words will be greatest around 40ms (replicating Gantman & Van Bavel)

## Person-based hypotheses
- People who are high in MFQ-salience for a particular foundation will respond more quickly/consistently to primes of higher weight within a particular foundation than those who are low MFQ-salience for that foundation.
- Democrats will respond more quickly/consistently to words that load highly on individualizing foundations whereas republicans will respond more quickly/consistently to words that load highly on binding foundations
  - This should be moderated by their strength of affiliation
